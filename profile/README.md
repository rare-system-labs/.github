## 🧠 What is Rare System Labs?

**Rare System Labs** is a collaborative engineering initiative focused on designing, building, and open-sourcing highly complex, real-world backend and systems software inspired by the foundational infrastructures of companies like **Google**, **Amazon**, **Apple**, **Meta**, **Microsoft**, **Netflix**, and **OpenAI**.

We reconstruct the **deep internal systems** — like identity engines, event sourcing platforms, deployment infra, sharded databases, API gateways, and encrypted vaults — with **industry-grade fidelity**, and make them **open to the world** for education, contribution, and innovation.

## 🔥 Why This Matters

Big Tech hides their deepest backend and systems architecture.  
We’re **reverse-engineering the principles**, rebuilding them from scratch, and making them **public, elegant, and functional** — for every engineer to learn from, build on, or even outperform.
